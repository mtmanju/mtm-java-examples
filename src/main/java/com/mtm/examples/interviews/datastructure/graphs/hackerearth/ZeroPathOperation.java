        Given a tree with N nodes with some non-negative value assigned to it. Lets say that the value of the ith  node is wi.
        The beauty of a path between nodes u and v (denoted by B(u,v)) is described as the sum of values of all nodes that lie on the path excluding the nodes u
        and v. Note that B(u,u) is always zero for any valid node . Ash is a weird guy. He only likes trees that have sum_{u = 1}^{N}\sum_{v = 1}^{N} B(u, v) = 0. In one operation Ash can change the value of any node to any non-negative value.
        Ash wants to find the minimum number of operations required so that he starts liking the given tree. But Ash does not have time to solve the
        problem as he is on his Pokemon adventure. So he needs your help in solving this problem.
